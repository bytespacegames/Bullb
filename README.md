#OpenFile
OpenFile is very straight forward, log OpenFile, and then whatever process name you want, by default it will go from the directory the exe is running in, and you can use slashes to go itno folders from ther,e or you can type the exact directory.
Example: 
```sh
OpenFile,Program2.exe
```
This should open Program2.exe in the same directory as your main exe file.
